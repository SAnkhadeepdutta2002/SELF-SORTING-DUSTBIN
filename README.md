# SELF-SORTING-DUSTBIN
Introducing Smart Dustbin - an innovative solution for effortless waste segregation and touch-free disposal. With multiple sensors, it efficiently separates wet and dry waste while ensuring germ-free operation to combat diseases.
Features Implemented
If the user stands at a distance x from the dustbin (x set by the creator), the lid opens automatically as sensed by the ultrasonic sensor.
At this moment, the user can throw the waste in the dustbin.
The waste product through the mouth of the dustbin goes through a chamber where it is distinguished between biodegradable or non-biodegradable.
According to the composition and moisture content of the waste the secondary lids open and the waste material is dropped there.
In case of a biodegradable chamber, it is monitored by an air quality sensor which monitors the air quality in it and if the quality starts to get poor which basically shows decaying it will lead to the switching ON of the indicator LEDs.
STRENGTHS
Helps in waste management. Easy sorting of waste between the bio and non-biodegradable. Instead of installing two bins for two separate waste this single bin can do both things. Comes up with an indicator which observes the condition of biodegradable waste and informs when it is mandatory to be removed. Prevents the foul odour from the waste from coming out to the surroundings. Contributes to Swachh Bharat Abhiyan

WEAKNESSES
Depending on the place where it is installed the power supply must be decided. In the case of outdoor, solar will work but in case of indoor batteries must be installed which can have periodic maintenance. Proper and periodic maintenance of the machine will be required to keep a check on all the electronic parts, which might be difficult to do on a large level.

OPPORTUNITIES
If implemented properly, it will be a great step towards making our campus and country smart. Can reduce the possibility of transfer of bacteria and germs and hence, reduce the transmission of diseases.

THREATS
It might be difficult to implement the project on a very large scale with limited number of requirements. We may face external barriers while trying to implement it on a national level.
